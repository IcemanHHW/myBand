        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          My name is IcemanHHW / Ice / Icy, whatever you wanna call me. And is you can guess I’m a fan of One Piece. <br />
          I started watching the anime in April 2015 and fell in love with it almost immediately. <br />
          I watched around 6 episodes every night and got up to date with the anime at the beginning of July. <br />
          After I got up to date with it I watched the new episode every week and I still do that to this day. <br /><br />

          At the beginning of February 2016 I started with reading the manga. It was a bit confusing at the beginning <br />
          I got up to date with the manga in 2/3 months and I must say that I loved every minute of it. <br />
          Just like with the anime, whenever a new chapter drops I read it immediately <br />
          and after that discuss the new chapter in a One Piece related chat I’m in. <br /> <br />

          But enough about me, let’s talk about the site for a bit. <br />
          One this site you can find pretty much everything that’s One Piece related. <br />
          And with that I mean news about new episodes / chapters, theories, news about new merchandise and other news. <br />
          So is this a news site? Yes and no, yes this site has news but it’s mainly an overview site that has links <br />
          to the site where you can read / watch the content that the news item is talking about. <br /> <br />
          And that's pretty much it. Enjoy your stay on this site :)
